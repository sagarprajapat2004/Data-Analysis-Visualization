# Data Analysis & Visualization Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves downloading and analyzing a dataset from Kaggle using NumPy and Pandas, creating insightful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and developing a Flask web application to showcase key data insights and conclusions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw data for meaningful analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Extracting insights and patterns using statistical techniques.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating impactful visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Web Dashboard:** Interactive web application using Flask to present insights in a user-friendly manner.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍 – Core programming language for data analysis and web development.
- **NumPy** 📊 – Efficient numerical computations and array manipulations.
- **Pandas** 🗄️ – Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib** 📈 – Customizable static visualizations.
- **Seaborn** 🎨 – High-level statistical visualizations.
- **Flask** 🌐 – Web framework for building interactive dashboards.
- **HTML, CSS** 🎨 – Frontend UI for the web application.

## 📊 Data Analysis Workflow
1. **Dataset Acquisition:** Downloading data from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Handling missing values, formatting, and preparing for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distribution, trends, and correlations.
4. **Data Visualization:** Graphical representation of key insights.
5. **Web Deployment:** Showcasing insights via a Flask-powered web application.

## 📸 Sample Visualizations
🔹 Heatmaps, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize trends and correlations.
